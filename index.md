# College - UC Berkeley 1996-2000

I knew I wanted to try and understand intelligence, and I bounced from neurology to cognitive science to, eventually, computer science. My AI class was a huge disappointment, since it was all symbols and planning. The neural nets class I took with Jerry Feldman was something else entirely - it was the first time I saw computers do something surprising.

# FrameNet 2000-2003

After Cal, I worked for three years as the chief programmer of the FrameNet project, at the International Computer Science Institute.

Skills & topics:
* Computational linguistics 
* Natural language processing
* Enterprise Java development
* Requirements gathering
* Engineering management

Lessons:
* Linguistics isn't my thing; I don't have the love of language, nor the patience to discuss the minutiae of usage

# Grad School - MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences 2003-2008

Still on the intelligence train, I felt like I _needed_ to get a PhD. I wasn't qualified to go to any of the top computer science programs, but somehow I managed to make it into MIT's graduate program in neuroscience.

Skills & topics:
* Systems neuroscience, including functional anatomy
* Computational neuroscience, including models of neuronal response and plasticity
* Bayesian statistics and probabilistic modeling/inference

Lessons:
* I can sustain effort and concentration on a single project over a long period of time. Looking back, this was an important, though expensively-bought, thing to show myself.

# Navia Systems 2007-2011

Skills & Topics:
* Probabilistic modeling & inference
* Probabilistic programming
* Stochastic hardware architecture
* Data science

# Prior Knowledge 2011-2012

Skills & topics
* API design
* Product management
* Data science
* Cloud service architecture and operations
