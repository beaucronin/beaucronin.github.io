# Beau Cronin

I am a technologist, an autodidact, a synthesizer, and a popularizer. I am always learning, and I tend to get restless once I have relied on any one skill for too long. I counteract my urge to move on by occasionally dedicating myself to longer projects that demand deeper knowledge - such as my PhD, or the book I am writing now. I have a hard time being interested in jobs that lend themselves to neat descriptions or titles. I am suspicious of mansplaining, and I can be dismissive of fields that are well enough defined and understood to allow for the arrogance of comfortable mastery. Myself, I'm pretty much always confused and overwhelmed.

I enjoy drawing connections between ideas from different fields, and I am attracted to projects that benefit from a wide range of experience. I am energized when I can act as the bridge between different sensibilities and personality types, and I am cursed by an instinct to assume others’ point of view. I am wary of cut-and-dry, emotionally satisfying solutions to difficult problems, but I’m pretty ruthless about ignoring the details that specialists often (rightly) find important.

In the past, I have been fixated on finding my one true calling - the single effort or subject that I could devote myself to completely and make into my life’s work. Recently, I have started to embrace my wandering nature, and I am shifting my focus more time-bounded projects, including an emphasis on bringing some fraction of them to a satisfying conclusion.

Here's a bit on my messy journey, still very much in progress. It's in chronological order, since it's a story in progress, rather than a triumphant march of progress leading to This One Moment. The skills listed in each section were important at the time, but many of them have faded; the lessons, I hope, are more enduring.

## College - UC Berkeley 1996-2000

I knew I wanted to try and understand intelligence, and I bounced from neurology to cognitive science to, eventually, computer science. My AI class was a huge disappointment, since it was all symbols and planning. The neural nets class I took with Jerry Feldman was something else entirely - it was the first time I saw computers do something surprising.

Skills & topics:

* General computer science: architecture, data structures, algorithms

## FrameNet 2000-2003

After Cal, I worked for three years as the chief programmer of the FrameNet project, at the International Computer Science Institute.

Skills & topics:

* Computational linguistics 
* Natural language processing
* Enterprise Java development
* Requirements gathering
* Engineering management

Lessons:

* Linguistics isn't my thing; I don't have the love of language, nor the patience to discuss the minutiae of usage

## Grad School - MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences 2003-2008

Still on the intelligence train, I felt like I _needed_ to get a PhD. I wasn't qualified to go to any of the top computer science programs, but somehow I managed to make it into MIT's graduate program in neuroscience.

Skills & topics:

* Systems neuroscience, including functional anatomy
* Computational neuroscience, including models of neuronal response and plasticity
* Bayesian statistics and probabilistic modeling/inference
* Computational cognitive science
* Scientific data analysis, Matlab

Lessons:

* I can sustain effort and concentration on a single project over a long period of time. Looking back, this was an important, though expensively-bought, thing to show myself.

## Navia Systems 2007-2011

I started Navia with [three](http://ericjonas.com/) [other MIT](http://web.mit.edu/vkm/www/) [grad students](https://plus.google.com/+KeithBonawitz/posts). We did a lot of really amazing applied research, and it was a truly formative experience. I got to wear a lot of hats, and I figured out as much about what I don't like doing (raising money, selling, stressing) as what I'm good at (writing, prototyping, working on a small team). Ultimately, this company was way ahead of it's time, and we were wildly over-ambitious.

Skills & Topics:

* Probabilistic modeling & inference
* Probabilistic programming
* Data science process and workflow
* Raising money and managing investors
* Team leadership
* Python

Lessons:

* I gained a healthy fear of the all-in, no boundaries startup lifestyle, which I'm still working through.
* Importance of focus and saying "no"
  * Four founders with equal stakes is a recipe for stalemate

## Prior Knowledge 2011-2012

Skills & topics:

* API design
* Product management
* Data science
* Cloud service architecture and operations
* Developer and community relations
* Shipping
* Python, Javascript

## Salesforce Part 1 2012-2014

(Much of this will have to wait a bit longer to get filled in)

Skills & topics:

* Product management
* Big-company dynamics and rhythms
* Company politics

Lessons:

* There's a big difference between innovation on small teams and within academia, and innovation in large companies

## Salesforce Part 2 2014-

## VR Explorations 2014-

Skills & topics:

* 3D programming, especially the WebGL/three.js/WebVR stack
